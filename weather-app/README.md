# Introduction 
This is the weather component for the Pyramid Routing Application. Will be an API that when called will return geojson information with polygon coordinates of bad weather filtered by bounds received in the call.

# Getting Started
The build and run scripts will build and run the container for the API. The API can then be accessed using http://localhost:8085/weather/get-bad-weather?bounds=POLYGON((-2.8 53.2, -2.2 53.2, -2.2 53.8, -2.8 53.8, -2.8 53.2)) (example url, bounds will come from the call)
